# How To Play
After the game starts, you will need to insert the name of the first player and his symbol.
Then, you will need to insert the name of the second player and his symbol will be generated automatically.
For placing your symbol on the board, on your turn, insert the number of the row and then the numbers of 
the column without space, from 0 to 2.
For example, if you want to place your symbol in the top right corner, write: `02`.
After the game ends, you can insert `q` for quitting and `r` to go another round!
